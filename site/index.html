<p>Art expresses emotions or is an expression of life. Art is a creation that allows for interpretation of any kind. I have read that art is considered a human skill as opposed to nature, a skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. I believe that nature is an art as well. If something is made by someone or by nature in a certain way, then itâ€™s unique and special in its own way.

Art is a creation through observation and interpretation of the art and the portrayal of their craft by the artist in whatever way they want whether it is viewed the same way as the observer or any way they see it. Intelligible and recognized thoughts and emotions of the world is considered to be art. Within the emotions and thoughts of the world, art enables those experiences to be intelligible and recognized.

Art is just like love and has so many definitions and examples for each. Therefore, I believe that art is not about perfection; art is something that continues to develop and grow as it is seen, meaning to open all generations of emotions, thoughts and human capacities.

Communication through art is what the artist use in their craft and works. For the long term, Jamaican artists were known to portray strong feeling through their work and art. Each art and the work in its way represented some ideas, emotions or feelings in either two dimensional or three-dimensional forms.

The work of art can either be a real piece or an abstract one depicting or telling stories and ideas. For most people, a piece of art that seem to stir the feelings and emotions of the viewer considers the main enjoyment in art.
