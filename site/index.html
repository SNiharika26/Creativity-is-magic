<p>Art expresses emotions or is an expression of life. Art is a creation that allows for interpretation of any kind. I have read that art is considered a human skill as opposed to nature, a skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. I believe that nature is an art as well. If something is made by someone or by nature in a certain way, then itâ€™s unique and special in its own way.
Art is a creation through observation and interpretation of the art and the portrayal of their craft by the artist in whatever way they want whether it is viewed the same way as the observer or any way they see it. Intelligible and recognized thoughts and emotions of the world is considered to be art. Within the emotions and thoughts of the world, art enables those experiences to be intelligible and recognized.
